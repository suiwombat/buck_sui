- Add optional zeroize support
- Add optional quickcheck support
- Add optional valuable support
- Make integers #[repr(transparent)].
- Make Slice struct #[repr(transparent)].
- Performance enhancement for `shr` methods
- Make wrapping_rem panic message same as for primitives
- Breaking: make unchecked_shl, unchecked_shr take u32 as shift argument, not Self.
- Fixed incorrect implementation of unchecked_shl, unchecked_shr for 64 bit digit integers.
- Fixed incorrect implementation of Add<$Digit> for all BUints
- Fixed lcm implementation to not panic if self is zero
- Changed to #[derive(PartialEq, Eq)] to allow pattern matching on const values.
- Added trait `BTryFrom` for fallible conversions between bnum integers (`TryFrom` can't be used due to the automatic implementation of `TryFrom<T> for T`).
- Don't require `std_rng` and `small_rng` features of rand crate except when testing.
